// 13.2 Define a class “String” that could work as user defined string type. 
// Include constructors that will enable us to create an uninitialized string 
// String s1; and also, to initialize an object with a string constant at the time 
// of creation like String s2 (“Well Done”); And also create copy constructor 
// to copy from string object to another string object. (Dynamic constructor)
